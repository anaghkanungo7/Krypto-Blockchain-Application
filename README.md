# Krypto Blockchain Application

A fullstack blockchain application demonstrating how we can create a blockchain application and have it interact with Solidity smart contracts

## Frontend

For the frontend part of this application, we will use React.

### Installing React

To initialize a react app, we have used Vite instead of the usual create-react-app. Vite is faster than create-react-app

### CSS

For our CSS, we will use Tailwind-CSS, a utility class for styling without writing much CSS.
